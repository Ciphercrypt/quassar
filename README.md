<h1 align="center" id="title">Smart City Traffic Management and Surveillance System</h1>

<p id="description">Welcome to our Hackathon project for the Smart City track! Our team is working on creating a traffic management and surveillance system to improve the safety and efficiency of the city's roads.</p>


<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<p1> We are using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for the front-end and back-end of our application. For machine learning, we are using Python and the YOLOv5 algorithm for object detection.

Our system uses feeds from various cameras installed on different traffic signals to monitor traffic in real-time. Using computer vision and YOLOv5, we are able to detect and capture license plate numbers from the video feeds. We then store this data in a database to track the movement of vehicles, which can be used for criminal investigations by authorities.

In addition to surveillance, we are analyzing traffic data to optimize traffic flow and identify traffic choke points. This information can be used to make real-time traffic adjustments to keep traffic moving smoothly.
